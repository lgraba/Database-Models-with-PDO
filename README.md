# Database Models with PDO

Tutorial from Alex Garrett at CodeCourse - thanks man!

### What we want to do:

- Hold database information in a class
- Allow manipulation of that data using the same class
- Use Composer PSR-4 Autoloading

### So far:

1. Set up environmental variables in .htaccess file available to Apache2
2. Create database schema for Users
3. Connect to database successfully
4. Create a User class for our User Model
5. Set up Composer with PSR-4 autoloading for all classes in Logan\Models\
6. Implement some more methods in User Class
7. Use Carbon library to manipulate datetimes within our User Model
