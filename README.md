Tutorial from Alex Garrett at CodeCourse - thanks man!

### What we want to do:

- Hold database information in a class
- Allow manipulation of that data using the same class
- Use Composer PS4 Autoloading

### So far:

1. Set up environmental variables in .htaccess file available to Apache2
2. Create database schema for Users
3. Connect to database successfully
